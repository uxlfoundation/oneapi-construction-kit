ComputeMux Compiler
===================

The ComputeMux Compiler is a collection of C++ interfaces that is used to
implement a compiler suite for ComputeMux hardware targets. ComputeMux provides
a base implementation of the various front-ends and optimization passes using
LLVM which *should* be used by a compiler implementation for a ComputeMux
device.

Each entry point required to implement a compiler targeting a specific
ComputeMux device is specified in the :doc:`ComputeMux Compiler Specification
</specifications/mux-compiler-spec>`, containing detail on the purpose of each
entry point, valid usage, and expected error codes. The :ref:`LLVM intermediate
representation <specifications/mux-compiler-spec:LLVM intermediate
representation>` section in particular provides detail about the LLVM IR that
is generated by the oneAPI Construction Kit.

LLVM
----

The ComputeMux Compiler hides its usage of LLVM behind a set of virtual
interfaces. This avoids the need for an open standards implementation linking
with the oneAPI Construction Kit, such as OpenCL and Vulkan, to also link with
LLVM, improving encapsulation.

The base implementation of the interfaces, such as ``BaseModule``, are
implemented using LLVM, and ComputeMux targets are expected to extend the base
implementation with their own back-end functionality. However, it is technically
possible (although not currently supported) to implement the interface classes
directly using a different compiler infrastructure. Builtin functions are
currently compiled to LLVM bitcode using ``clang`` as part of the CMake build
process.

The list of LLVM versions supported by ComputeMux can be found :ref:`here
<overview/compiler/supported-llvm-versions:Supported LLVM Versions>`.

Building a ComputeMux Compiler
------------------------------

A ComputeMux compiler is responsible for taking an :ref:`LLVM module
<overview/compiler/ir:Intermediate Representation>` representing a program
under compilation and producing object code.

Since ComputeMux provides a standard set of target-agnostic IR passes to
provide all required functionality, the **minimum** required of a ComputeMux
compiler is the `LLVM Code Generator`_, or *backend*. This component is
responsible for translating LLVM intermediate representation to machine code
for the target.

The requirements on the *subset* of LLVM IR that must be supported ultimately
depend on the higher-level compute standard being implemented with ComputeMux. As
the following sections will outline, ComputeMux **shall not** require anything
of a compiler backend that isn't representable with standard open-source and
target-agnostic LLVM IR.

.. tip::
  As a general rule, a compiler backend which supports C99 will provide 99% of
  the functionality required by the standards built on top of ComputeMux. Note
  that there are several features of C99 which are **not** required; see
  the list of :doc:`/overview/compiler/non-requirements`.

  ComputeMux supports the x86, x86-64, 32-bit ARM, 64-bit ARM (AArch64) and
  RISC-V targets using their respective open-source LLVM compiler backends.
  Each target initially required minimal (or no) modifications to get them
  working.

A compiler backend is **not** required to support every source-level type or IR
operation in hardware. The LLVM code generator is adept at *legalizing* both
unsupported types and operations, re-expressing the same program using only
legal types and operations. This process requires only minimal work in the
target-specific code. LLVM's documentation provides an in-depth guide to the
`LLVM Instruction Selector`_ which is responsible for this process.

While targets **may** implement a minimal ComputeMux compiler with standard IR
and using a simple C99 backend as a basis, targets **may** use the configurable
nature of ComputeMux to write compiler *passes* which optimize code in a way
that maximizes performance for the target. One example could be to optimize
code using target-specific compiler builtin functions (intrinsics). The
compiler backend in particular has a lot of scope with which to optimize the
generated code.

The following sections describe the :doc:`/overview/compiler/ir` that forms
ComputeMux programs, as well as any specific requirements on a backend. The
list of :doc:`/overview/compiler/non-requirements` may help to narrow the scope
of language features which **are not** required.
