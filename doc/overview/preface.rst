Preface
=======

This document provides an introduction to Codeplay's oneAPI Construction Kit.
It should help the reader understand how to use the oneAPI Construction Kit to
create a high-performance implementation of open-standards for a processor or
system, i.e. SYCL or OpenCL.  This implementation will enable programmers to use a
well-understood programming model, and allow all parties to benefit from the
open-standards software ecosystem.

This document will primarily be of interest to anyone considering such an
implementation. That could include a systems architect, a processor designer, a
compiler engineer, a language runtime engineer, a driver engineer, etc.  After
reading this document you should understand what the oneAPI Construction Kit
provides, how it fits in with your existing hardware and software, and what
requirements it places on that hardware or software.
