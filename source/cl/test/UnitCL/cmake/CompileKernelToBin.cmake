#[=======================================================================[.rst:
A `CMake script`_ that wraps the ``clc`` tool and compiles the offline kernels
that are used for testing. All the necessary option and requirement parsing are
performed to determine whether compilation is even required, and if it is, what
the ``clc`` invocation should be. A stub file is created when compilation is
not required, enabling dependency tracking and automatic rebuilding when kernel
sources change. The expected use case is that this script will be wrapped in a
custom command.

.. warn::
  This script must be run from the ComputeAorta root directory (i.e., with
  ``WORKING_DIRECTORY ${ComputeAorta_SOURCE_DIR}``) so that dependencies can be
  found.

The following variables must be defined when this script is invoked (using
``-DOPTION_NAME=value``):

.. cmake:variable:: INPUT_FILE

  The file that will be compiled. It will be a ``.cl``, a ``.bc{32|64}`` or a
  ``.spv{32|64}`` file.

.. cmake:variable:: OUTPUT_FILE

  The compiled executable file. It will be a ``.bin``.

.. cmake:variable:: CLC_EXECUTABLE

  Absolute path to the ``clc`` executable that will be used for compilation.
  ``CLC_EXECUTABLE`` may contain a ``qemu`` invocation of ``clc`` when ``clc``
  has been built for another architecture.

.. cmake:variable:: DEVICE_NAME

  The name of the OpenCL device that ``clc`` will compile for. This must match
  one of the devices that the provided ``clc`` supports.

.. cmake:variable:: TARGET_CAPABILITIES

  The list of capabilities supported by device ``DEVICE_NAME``. This is used to
  determine whether compilation is possible.

.. cmake:variable:: IMAGE_SUPPORT

  Boolean for whether device ``DEVICE_NAME`` supports images (since image
  support is not treated as a capability). This is used to determine whether
  compilation is possible.

The following variable may optionally be defined:

.. cmake:variable:: INPUT_CL_FILE

  File to parse for target device requirements and compilation options. It must
  be a ``.cl`` file.

  .. warning::
    Only ``INPUT_CL_FILE`` is ever parsed, even when ``INPUT_FILE`` is a
    ``.cl`` file. Consequently, when ``INPUT_FILE`` is a ``.cl`` file, the same
    ``.cl`` file is passed to this script twice.

  .. note::
    ``INPUT_CL_FILE`` is  determined when the custom command wrapping this
    script is created so that dependencies can be tracked correctly, and this
    script can be re-run when ``INPUT_CL_FILE`` changes (even when
    ``INPUT_FILE`` is an IR file and not a ``.cl`` file).
