Bring Native CPU pipeline files into dpc++ directly.

This brings the Native CPU compiler pipeline files directly under the ownership
of intel/llvm. This removes the direct dependence on the oneAPI Construction
Kit, although the history of those files still exists under intel/llvm and the
originals still exist at
https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneapi-construction-kit.

This was done as follows:

In the oneAPI Construction Kit repo:

```
    git-filter-repo --paths-from-file $script_dir/native_cpu_paths.txt \
    --path-rename modules/compiler/compiler_pipeline:llvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils/compiler_passes/compiler_pipeline \
    --path-rename modules/compiler/vecz:llvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils/compiler_passes/vecz \
    --path-rename modules/compiler/multi_llvm/include/multi_llvm:llvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils/compiler_passes/compiler_pipeline/include/multi_llvm \
    --path-rename doc/modules/vecz/vecz.md:llvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils/compiler_passes/vecz/vecz.md \
    --path-rename doc/modules/compiler/overview.rst:llvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils/compiler_passes/compiler_pipeline/docs/overview.rst \
    --path-rename doc/modules/compiler/utils.rst:llvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils/compiler_passes/compiler_pipeline/docs/utils.rst
```

Under intel/llvm:

```
    git checkout sycl
    git checkout -b $llvm_branch
    git fetch $ock_fork $ock_branch
    # Update CMake to be more llvm like
    # clang-format-20 on added files
    # Add some new documentation to reflect the state of play.
    git merge -m "[NATIVE_CPU][SYCL] Merge from oneAPI Construction Kit into native_cpu" --allow-unrelated-histories ock_fork/$ock_branch
```


`llvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils/CMakeLists.txt` was updated to remove the fetch
content and the ugly install workaround. Missing is the lit tests for the
pipeline tests as these refer to the use of a non-ported tool, `muxc`.
CMakeLists.txt across was updated to use LLVM macros across `compiler_pipeline`
and `vecz` ported code, as well as changing `NATIVECPU_USE_OCK` to be the
default. It also applies clang-format-20 to all the .h and .cpp files brought
in. Other than that the .cpp and .h files are unchanged. The lit tests cfg files
were updated to fit with LLVM, and a small change was made to avoid use of
`undef`.

A brief explanation and limitations of the importing of the files are under
`llvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils/compiler_passes/compiler_passes.rst`.
